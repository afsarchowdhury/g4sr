`g4sr` is an API wrapper for Go4Schools. It allows you to manage school
data. Authentication is required for all requests. See your school’s
administrator for an API key.

## Installation

You can install the development version of g4sr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("afsarchowdhury/g4sr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(g4sr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
#summary(cars)
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
